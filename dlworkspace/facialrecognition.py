"""
Here we have the model or models that deal with facial recognition. This class will be more involved as it will
keep track of identified and unidentified persons. Each individual has a unique feature embedding, and this
class will keep a reference database between identities and embeddings.

We will likely be using FaceNet, which is a siamese neural network that can idenitfy people with a single image.
Multiple images are still required for training, but we can simultaneously classify persons whose identities we are
certain of as well as prepare training data.
