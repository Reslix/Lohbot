"""
This file contains the object that encapsulates SegNet, which colors in features of an image
corresponding to various classes. This is important for our robot as it allows it to identify regions that
it can traverse as well as potential areas to avoid or focus on.

This particular Segnet is trained on the Pascal VOC 2012 dataset.
